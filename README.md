# Traffic-Sign-Detection-and-Recognition

+ The project aims to detect Traffic Signs on a live video feed from a camera or a pre-rendered feed for the algorithm's input. 
+ Creating accurate machine learning models capable of localizing and identifying multiple objects in a single image remains a core challenge in computer vision. The TensorFlow Object Detection API is an open-source framework built on top of TensorFlow, making it easy to construct, train and deploy object detection models.
+ In this study, TensorFlow's Object Detection API is used in German and Czech traffic sign detection and recognition of the intended traffic signboards. A data set is compiled for traffic signs using photographs in different traffic and weather conditions.
+ A Convolutional Neural Network was built from scratch to optimize the performance of such algorithms on extremely power-efficient computers.
+ Created a video pipeline to send the video feed, one frame after another, to process, detect and classify traffic signs in the image.
+ Developed a Deep-Learning solution to detect vehicles and traffic signals for cheaper hardware with a decent frame rate of 10-18 fps.
